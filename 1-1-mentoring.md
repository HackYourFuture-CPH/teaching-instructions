# 1:1 Mentoring

**Getting started** <br>
This is a short guide for starting your 1:1 mentorship for a HYF student who might need extra help in order to get ready for the job market.

**Goal** <br>
The goal of this initiative is to offer each student a particular mentor who they know they can always ask about any questions they might have. It shouldn't be overwhelming - that's why there's only one student. If you feel like it's becoming too much work - let us know and we'll match a different mentor with the student. 

**Checklist** <br>

- Check in with the student weekly - see how they're doing!
- Check their homework performance - watch out that they don't fall behind on their homeworks!
- Meeting once for a coffee, or at your work (even better)
- Making sure the student has a CV and Linkedin ready after JS 3 module
- Drag the student to a meetup you think is relevant or fun! Just once is already great!
- Send the student relevant internship/job postings
- Sit with the student and watch them seek jobs online or make an application
