# 1:1 Mentoring

**Getting started** <br>
This is a short guide for starting your 1:1 mentorship for a HYF student who might need extra help in order to get the most out of our community and to get ready for the job market.

**Goal** <br>
The goal of this added mentorship is to offer each student a particular point-of-contact whom they know they can always reach out to - with coding or job market-related questions they might have. It shouldn't be an overwhelming task though - that's why there's only one student per mentor. If you feel like it's becoming too much responsibility - let us know and we'll match a different mentor with the student. 

**Checklist** <br>

- Check in with the student weekly - see how they're doing and let them know there is someone there to support them! (e.g. on Wednesday: "How is homework going?")
- Check their homework performance - watch out that they don't fall behind on their homeworks! [homework-app](https://hyf-homework-assesment.herokuapp.com/)
- Meeting once for a coffee, or at your work (even better!)
- Making sure the student has a CV and Linkedin ready after ca. the JS 3 module
- Drag the student to a meetup you think is relevant or fun! Just once is already great!
- Send the student relevant internship/job postings
- Sit with the student and watch them seek jobs online or make an application - small things can often be a barrier to students, so it's good to check if they approach the job hunt correctly!

**Anything I should keep in mind?** <br>
Just remember to:<br>
- Stay open in regards to their culture, engage and explore it.
- Be mindful, but don't feel afraid to be yourself. People will usually let you know if you’re doing something wrong.
- Be aware that you are in a position of greater privilege and power.
