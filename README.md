# Teacher's Guide

>First and foremost we need to remember why we teach and who is our audience. We want to not only teach concepts as a total truth, but much mores prepare our students for navigating through Google and how they can read up on the topic later. The resources we use are almost without exception geared towards a Western audience, but we need to keep in mind that our students seldom have the same access to this as we do. So our goal is to: guide people towards the right resources and help them understand - but no excessive spoon-feeding of information. <p>
 We build on experiential learning and peer assisted learning, two of the few uncontested didactic paradigms. That means we try to do as much hands-on work in class as possible, as well as fostering collaboration between students.

### Teaching Timetable
A Google sheet where you can mark your unavailable weeks and keep track of who has been teaching what modules so far can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uYSzLetZxhIUIlpk0Si3KgQ9I1-yniif37-Te_7X4j8/edit?usp=sharing).

### Step-by-step guide for teaching
In order to assure good continuity and retention of knowledge within our program, as well as the highest quality teaching for our students we have certain processes that we need to adhere to in every module.

1. **Preparation.** <br>As a starting point for every time a new teacher takes any module, make sure that what is taught actually is within the given learning goals. Also make sure that the students are equipped to solve the homework without too much frustration.
You can also familiarise yourself with the pre-readings for the class and what students have learned so far (there exists a dedicated mentor channel for each class, usually called "classXX-mentors") 
For inspiration we can always check out the respective [Amsterdam repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum) corresponding to the module we are teaching.

2. **Recording of sessions.** <br>We do screen recordings of all sessions for students who cannot attend or want to revisit parts of the session later. We use a software called OBS [here](https://obsproject.com/) for this. You can send the video files to Christopher after class and he will take care of uploading and posting it on Slack, but you can also upload them on your own channel (and we will just add them to a playlist). You can also use whatever other programs you prefer for screen recording - just keep the file size in mind so we don't need to compress too much. For OBS [this](https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/obs-for-screen-recording-video-and-output-settings--cms-28542) is a recommended preset. You can see an example of a recorded session [here](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=72CMjs61vIw).

3. **Schedule for the day.** <br> Experience shows that it’s a great help to show students an agenda for the day. Breaks should be honoured and kept to their intended length. We take short breaks every 45 minutes, as well as a long lunch break at 14:00 (ca.). Trying to adhere this structure helps keeping focus and keeps energy up.

4. **Personal introduction.** <br>
When you start teaching a class, consider kicking it off by briefly explaining what kind of work you do and how you use the frameworks we teach in your daily life. Experience shows that this isn't at all evident to many of our students, so it's a great motivation for them to get a real life, tangible example.

5. **Teaching techniques.** <br> 
Not everyone has teaching experience or a background in didactics, but don't fret. We try to always mix experienced teachers and new ones. It is of course an advantage to know how to convey knowledge well, but we try to model our classes after some uncontested principles for the best results for learning: experiential learning (hands-on work) and peer-assisted learning (students helping one another).  
In practice this means that we try to use as few powerpoint slides as possible (ideally none) and focus on Live coding examples, group exercises and anything else that keeps people's hands on their keyboards and makes them learn. Check out this repo for some more tips and tricks: [teaching_tips_and_tricks](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/teaching_tips_tricks).  
Our [Copenhagen curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum) will provide a list of learning goals for every module on its readme. When you go into individual repos for the different modules, e.g. [HTML/CSS](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/HTML-CSS), you will find further, week specific learning goals, exercises and homework there as well.  
"_Not much left for me to do_" you say? Not unless you want to! We try to build on what we have done so far and not reinvent the wheel each time, but you are always more than welcome to create your own exercises, homework and make pull requests with your suggested changes. Most important is that we cover the learning goals. As a teacher this curriculum becomes as much your effort as ours, don't be afraid to make your mark!

6. **Homework.** <br>
Homework is a substantial and crucial part of our program. We need to dedicate a lot of effort to this despite the often underwhelming participation by students.<br>
The repos are split up by weeks (week 1, week 2, week 3 etc) and all individually contain an overview, reading homework and homework assignment. Make sure to be on top of these repos and make PR's where necessary so that we don't have redundancies, dead links, confusing or misleading information in there.
  
7. **Previous week's homework.** <br> 
We received feedback from students several times that they would like to see a “perfect solution” for the homework - the way you would write it, or the way you intended it to look. If this makes sense, then in the end of the class upload a solution for the homework on Slack. Then the students can look at it in their own time. Another helpful thing can be to adress common issues the students had with the homework.

8. **Feedback partners.** <br>
At the end of each session we determine feedback partners - 2 students who will give one another feedback on their homework. *Make sure they understand why and how to do this!* Students can learn a lot from seeing the mistakes of their peers and can often explain things they only recently learned in simpler terms than the teachers who have multiple years of experience.<p>
You can either select the feedback teams yourself (try to make good matches) or determine a *class representative* who takes responsibility for picking the feedback partners for everyone. 

9. **Breaks** <br>
We take a long break around 14:00, to have lunch. (About 20 minutes). Otherwise, make sure to rememember to take short breaks about every 45 minutes as it is a lot to take in for students and concentration will understandably drop if we don't take breaks.

10. **Feedback.** <br>
We give feedback on the homework uploaded to GitHub via issues. The extent of the feedback is up to you, but of course the students benefit from explanations. The preferred way of providing feedback is via annotating single [line](https://github.com/ShazaMaher/week-01/issues/1) or range of [lines](https://github.com/ShazaMaher/week-01/issues/2). Alternatively a [general issue](https://github.com/chsaqib/hyf-html-css/issues/1) with a review can be created.

11. **After the module ends.** <br> Remember you still have an outstanding homework. We tend to revise this at the start of the next session, but if you aren’t available you can also do it whenever it suits into your schedule. We just feel it's important to follow up on all homework so the students don't feel like their work is in vain. (Especially important during the first 4 modules)

12. **Don't forget about the fun** <br>
If you have an idea about how to combine the teaching with some more fun exercises - do it. Our curriculum is challenging and sometimes dry (it has to be), but that doesn't mean we can't take some digressions to have some fun and get the energy levels in the class up. Mitigating 'code scare' or demystifying the world of programming can be super important, especially in the start. <p>
A good resource for fun exercises is the [teaching_tips_and_tricks](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/teaching_tips_tricks) repo. It's a collaborative effort between all HYF chapters and PR's are more than welcome!
