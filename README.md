# Teacher's Guide

>First and foremost we need to remember why we teach and who is our audience. We want to not only teach concepts as a total truth, but much mores prepare our students for navigating through Google and how they can read up on the topic later. The resources we use are almost without exception geared towards a Western audience, but we need to keep in mind that our students seldom have the same access to this as we do. So our goal is to: guide people towards the right resources and help them understand - but no excessive spoon-feeding of information. <p>
 We build on experiential learning and peer assisted learning, two of the few uncontested didactic paradigms. That means we try to do as much hands-on work in class as possible, as well as fostering collaboration between students.

### What’s the difference between a mentor and a teacher? 
A `mentor` is anyone who volunteers to help in our initiative and is part of our Slack community. This can entail answering questions on Slack, helping with events, helping with homework feedback or other flexible tasks.

A `teacher` is any mentor who is taking charge of a module and teaching the actual contents of the curriculum. Being a teacher comes with a certain amount of responsibility and time commitment. We would never ask something of you that you don’t want to do, but be aware that we trust you to be present and prepared for the sessions pertaining to the module you teach. Every module is taught by two teachers, so you are not solely responsible, but we expect that you communicate well with your teaching partner how to split up the tasks related to teaching.

### Step-by-step guide for teaching
 In order to assure good continuity and retention of knowledge within our program, as well as the highest quality teaching for our students we have certain processes that we need to adhere to in every module.

1. **Preparation.** <br>As a starting point for every time a new teacher takes any module we should always direct our view towards the respective [Amsterdam repo](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum), then as a second step towards our own current repo - just so you know what there is to work with. Not to say that the AMS repos are better than what we come up with, but they simply have more people working on it, have dedicated staff for this and continuously update it. It’s important to be aware that their students have a higher level than ours. That’s a matter of circumstance that we cannot change, so we will always have to be a little less ambitious, if we want to retain and treat fairly our own students. Familiarise yourself with the pre-readings for the class and what students have learned so far (dedicated mentor channel for each class)

2. **Recording of sessions.** <br>We do screen recordings of all sessions for students who cannot attend or want to revisit parts of the session later. We use a software called OBS [here](https://obsproject.com/) for this. You can send the video files to Christopher after class and he will take care of uploading and posting it on Slack. Optionally you can also use Youtube live (guide). Ask Christopher for the HYF-cph Youtube account info.

3. **Schedule for the day.** <br> Experience shows that it’s a great help to show students an agenda for the day. Breaks should be honoured and kept to their intended length. We take short breaks every 45 minutes, as well as a long lunch break at 14:00 (ca.). Trying to adhere this structure helps keeping focus and keeps energy up.

4. **Personal introduction** <br>
When you start teaching a class, consider kicking it off by briefly explaining what kind of work you do and how you use the frameworks we teach in your daily life. Experience shows that this isn't at all evident to many of our students, so it's a great motivation for them to get a real life, tangible example.

5. **Previous week's homework.** <br> We received feedback from students several times that they would like to see a “perfect solution” for the homework - the way you would write it, or the way you intended it to look.

6. **Homework.** <br>
In depth explanation coming soon.

7. **Feedback partners.** <br>
At the end of each session we determine feedback partners - 2 students who will give one another feedback on their homework. Students can learn a lot from seeing the mistakes of their peers and can often explain things they only recently learned in simpler terms than the teachers who have multiple years of experience.<p>
You can either select the feedback teams yourself (try to make good matches) or determine a "class representative" who takes responsibility for picking the feedback partners for everyone. 

8. **Feedback.** <br>
We give feedback on the homework uploaded to GitHub via issues. The extent of the feedback is up to you, but of course the students benefit from explanations. The preferred way of providing feedback is via annotating single [line](https://github.com/ShazaMaher/week-01/issues/1) or range of [lines](https://github.com/ShazaMaher/week-01/issues/2). Alternatively a [general issue](https://github.com/chsaqib/hyf-html-css/issues/1) with a review can be created.

9. **After the module ends.** <br> Remember you still have an outstanding homework. We tend to revise this at the start of the next session, but if you aren’t available you can also do it whenever it suits into your schedule. We just feel it's important to follow up on all homework so the students don't feel like their work is in vain. (Especially important during the first 4 modules)

10. **Don't forget about the fun** <br>
If you have an idea about how to combine the teaching with some more fun exercises - do it. Our curriculum is challenging and sometimes dry (it has to be), but that doesn't mean we can't take some digressions to have some fun and get the energy levels in the class up. Mitigating 'code scare' or demystifying the world of programming can be super important, especially in the start. <p>
A good resource for fun exercises is the [teaching_tips_and_tricks](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/teaching_tips_tricks) repo. It's a collaborative effort between all HYF chapters and PR's are more than welcome!
